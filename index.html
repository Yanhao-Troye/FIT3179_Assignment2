              <p>A unicorn means a privately owned startup valued at over $1 billion. 
                 The term "unicorn" has been widely used to refer to startups in technology, 
                 mobile technology, and information technology.
                 Now, I'm going to show you some information about unicorns and hopefully 
                 provide you some insight into future investments and business.</p>

            <h2> Unicorn Companies all over the world</h2>
            <p> As of March 30, 2022, there were over 1000 unicorns in the world. 
              More than half of the unicorns are in the United States. Another 180 unicorns are in China.
              India ranks third in the international Unicorn rankings, followed by the United Kingdom and Germany. 
              Unicorns are now found on every continent, but a glance at the map shows that their populations are relatively small in Latin America and Africa.

            <h2>Top 5 countries with most unicorns and their industry flow</h2>
            <p> By the distribution of unicorn industries across major countries, 
              you can determine whether there are opportunities based on the characteristics of the region. 
              As we can see USA and China dominate in terms of the diversity of industries. 
              Most U.S. unicorns are concentrated in Internet Software and Fintech.  
              Meanwhile, China's unicorns are more evenly distributed across various sectors. 
              Other countries, like India and the UK, show industry specialization but at a smaller scale.
